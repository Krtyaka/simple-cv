# Single Page CV — HTML-Only Project

This project is a solution to the **Single-Page CV** challenge from Roadmap.sh.

The goal of this assignment is to build a clean, structured, single-page Curriculum Vitae using **only HTML**, without any CSS or JavaScript. The project focuses on semantic HTML, accessibility, SEO, Open Graph tags, and proper document structure.

---

## 📄 Project Description

This CV is built entirely using **semantic HTML elements**, including:

- `header`, `main`
- `h1`–`h3` heading hierarchy
- `ul` and `li` for lists
- SEO and Open Graph meta tags

The layout is intentionally unstyled and prepared for future styling in later projects.
